[DAIL] 059

Pick the campaign or game mode you wish to install:

(ng) - Vanilla mob density and mob scaling
(b) - Vanilla mob density with increased hero/boss spawns
(s) - High mob density with increased hero/boss spawns
(x) - (b) density with increased mob scaling challenge
(sx) - (s) density with increased mob scaling challenge

(gde) - Grim Dawn : Eternal
(dga) - Dynamicaly Generated Areas

Important!

All campaign modes are once again labeled DAIL.arz. Transfer stash and recipe files will
need to play musical chairs once again. I recommend the GD_Stash tool:

Find the appropriate arz file in DAIL/database/*/*.arz and copy to DAIL/database
Rename the DAIL root folder name to match the gde or dga arz file. 

Grim Dawn Eternal and DGA have unique arc files that need to be added to the resources folder.
This unique files are found in DAIL/resources/*_unique. Copy and paste to DAIL/resources.

Remove these arc files from the the resource folder when changing modes.
There is a back up scripts.arc for campaign in DAIL/resources/campaign_backup.

Make multiple copies of the DAIL and rename as needed to have multiple play modes available
without having to rename or move files around.

I'm trying to get the NSIS installer to automate all of this, but I have yet to figure it out.
Should anyone familiar with this process wish to help, please do.
