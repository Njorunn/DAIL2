# DAIL2
DAIL simplified for simple minded dev. 

DAIL is a mod compilation for the game Grim Dawn.

DAIL source is provided for those who wish to contribute to the project, or make edits for private use.
Otherwise, DAIL is not to be altered, renamed, ripped (other than for seeing how functions are set up and linked), 
or distributed for monetary gain.

The mods in DAIL are there by permission, or the author has an open license. The authors of the mods retain
creative ownership of the content. See the Features_and_Versions.txt file in the Dev_Info folder for a complete
listing of the mods and their authors.

A lot of time has been invested in making these mods work together by Davood, Kathanious, and AlienFromBeyond.
And a lot of time has been invested into making the individual mods by their authors. Please be respectful
with the content.
